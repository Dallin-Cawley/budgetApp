                                Fluffy Mustard
                                       
2 beaten egg yolks
1 T. sugar (I add a little extra)
3 T. mustard (not dry, just regular mustard)
2 T. vinegar
1 T. water
(3/4) t. salt

1 T. butter
1 T. horseradish (optional) I don't usually add
(1/2) c. cream before whipping (I use more than this)

Stir together the first six ingredients and heat over a double boiler stirring constantly.  (I don't use a double boiler.  I just cook on very low heat or the eggs curdle) until it thickens, don't boil.  It only takes a few minutes.  Then stir in the butter and horseradish.  Cool.  Fold into whipped cream.
