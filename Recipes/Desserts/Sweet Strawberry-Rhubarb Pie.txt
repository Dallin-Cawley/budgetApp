                         Sweet Strawberry-Rhubarb Pie
Ingredients:
1 pie pastry
(3/4) c. sugar
Pinch of salt
1/3 c. all-purpose flour
2 c. trimmed, sliced strawberries (fresh or thawed from frozen)
2 c. chopped rhubarb (cut in (1/2) inch pieces)
 
Instructions: Simmer (poach) rhubarb with (1/4) inch water and a little sugar in the bottom of a small saucepan with the lid on for 15 minutes.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry.  Combine sugar, salt, and flour.  Arrange half the strawberries and rhubarb in the pie pan.  Sprinkle with half the sugar mixture.  Repeat with remaining fruit and sugar mixture.  Bake for 40-50 minutes or until rhubarb is tender and crust is golden (if crust begins to brown too quickly, cover crust with strips of aluminum foil) Let cool slightly and serve warm with vanilla ice cream.
