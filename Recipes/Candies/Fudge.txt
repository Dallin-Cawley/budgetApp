Ingredients:
1 (3/4) c. sugar
1 sm. can (3 oz.) evaporated milk
1 jar Kraft marshmallow cream
1 (1/2) cubes real butter
1 t. vanilla
1 c. chopped walnuts
(3/4)-1 c. milk chocolate chips, more if you like darker fudge
Instructions: (Use the heaviest pot you have, like magnalite, so it doesn't scorch) Butter the bottom and sides of cooking pot.  On medium high heat, melt butter.  Add evaporated milk and sugar.  Use a whipper and blend well, stirring constantly to keep from scorching.  Bring to a boil and boil for 5 minutes exactly.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate chips.  Mix well.
