                                Mac and Cheese
                                       
Ingredients:

4 cups whole-grain elbow macaroni
2 Tbsp unsalted butter
2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
2 cups skim milk
1 cup low-fat cheddar cheese, grated
(1/4) cup parmesan cheese, grated
2 oz. reduced-fat cream cheese
(1/2) tsp dry mustard powder
(1/2) tsp Worcestershire sauce
freshly ground black pepper
salt

Instructions:

In large pot of boiling salted water, cook macaroni 1 minute less than package directions suggest. Drain well, set aside. Return pot to stove top; melt butter in a pot over medium-high heat. Whisk flour and cook 1 minute. Slowly whisk in milk; simmer until bubbling and slightly thickened. Whisk in cheeses, mustard powder, Worcestershire sauce, and pepper to taste. Add pasta to cheese sauce and cook about 1 minute until heated through. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
