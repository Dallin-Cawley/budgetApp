                    Vanilla Sugar Cookies (with variations)
                                       
Ingredients:

(3/4) cup softened butter
1 cup sugar
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla 
(1/8) tsp salt
2 cups all-purpose flour

Instructions:  

Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer. Add egg, vanilla, and salt; beat until smooth. With a spoon, stir in flour to form a stiff dough. Divide the dough in half. Wrap each half in wax paper to form a cylinder about 1-(1/2) inches in diameter. Refrigerate dough until firm. Cut dough into (1/2) inch slices. Arrange on greased baking sheet and bake at 350Â° for 12-15 minutes.  
Orange Poppy Seed Cookies: Add 2 Tbsp poppy seed and (1/2) tsp orange extract before adding flour. Flatten sides of wrapped dough to form a rectangular shape before chilling.  
Raspberry Thumbprints: Add 1 tsp lemon extract and (1/2) tsp almond extract before adding flour. Roll each (1/4) inch slice into a ball. Make an indent in the center of each cookie with thumb and fill with (1/2) tsp raspberry preserves.  
Cinnamon Pecan Shortbread: Add 1 cup chopped pecans before adding flour. Sprinkle (1/4) inch slices generously with cinnamon sugar before baking.
