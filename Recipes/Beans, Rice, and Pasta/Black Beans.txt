                              Black Beans (Cuban)
                                       
Ingredients:

1 lb. black beans, soak and pressure cooked
1 green pepper, saut√©ed
1 onion, finely chopped
4 garlic cloves
(2/3) cup olive oil
4 tsp salt
(1/2) tsp pepper
(1/4) tsp oregano
1 bay leaf
2 Tbsp sugar
2 Tbsp vinegar
2 Tbsp white wine

Instructions:

Cook garlic cloves in olive oil, then add to the beans with salt, pepper, oregano, bay leaf, sugar, vinegar, and white wine. You can try starting with (1/2) the salt.  The white wine could be left out.  I use cooking wine which has salt so that may be why I start with less salt.
