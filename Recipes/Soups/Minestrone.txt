                                  Minestrone
Ingredients:
(1/4) c. olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 medium carrot, chopped
1 medium celery stalk, chopped
Salt and black pepper
2 large potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
1 c. chopped tomatoes
1 medium zucchini, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 bunch kale, chopped
1 c. canned cannellini beans, drained
(1/2) c. parmesan cheese
Instructions: In large pot, heat (1/4) c. oil over medium heat.  Add onion, carrot, and celery.  Sprinkle salt and pepper to taste.  Cook stirring often, for 10-15 minutes or until vegetables begin to soften and darken around the edges.  Add potatoes; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring occasionally for 5-10 minutes or until vegetables are nicely browned.  Add 6 cups water, stirring to scrape up any brown bits from bottom of pot.  Add tomatoes, bring to a boil, and then lower  heat to a simmer.  Cook, stirring occasionally for about 15 minutes.  Add zucchini and kale, raising heat if needed to keep at steady bubble.  Cook until vegetables are very tender, another 10-15 minutes.  Stir in beans.  Cook for 3-4 minutes.  Add salt and pepper if needed.  Top with parmesan cheese and a drizzle of olive oil.
