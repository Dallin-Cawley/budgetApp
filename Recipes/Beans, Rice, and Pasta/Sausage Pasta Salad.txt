                              Sausage Pasta Salad
                                       
Ingredients:

1 (1/2) cups medium shelled pasta
4 oz. fully cooked Polish sausage
3 slices bacon
(1/2) cup sliced fresh mushrooms (you can use more)
4 tsp sugar
1 (1/2) tsp flour
4 dashes salt
(1/3) cup water
2 Tbsp white vinegar
1 Tbsp snipped parsley

Instructions: 

Cook pasta according to package directions, drain, and set aside. Meanwhile, slice sausage into (1/2) inch slices. Set aside. In a 10 inch skillet, cook bacon until crisp; drain, reserving 1 Tbsp drippings in skillet. (If you want more sauce than what the recipe calls for, double the amount of drippings, sugar, flour, water, and vinegar.  I would recommend making more sauce, as the pasta tends to absorb the sauce, especially if you have leftovers) Crumble bacon and set aside. Cook mushrooms in drippings until tender. Stir in sugar, flour, and pepper; stir in water and vinegar. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 1 minute more. Stir in cooked pasta, sausage, bacon, and parsley. Heat through.
