                              Chocolate Silk Pie
Ingredients:
1 c. whipping cream
1 6 oz. pkg. semisweet chocolate pieces
1/3 c. butter
1/3 c. sugar
2 beaten egg yolks
3 T. crème de cacao or whipping cream
1 baked 8 or 9 inch pastry shell
Whipped cream or pressurized whipped dessert topping (optional)
Chocolate curls or miniature chocolate pieces (optional)

Instructions: In a heavy 2 quart saucepan combine the 1 c. whipping cream, chocolate pieces, butter, and sugar.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, till chocolate is melted.  This should take about 10 minutes.  Remove saucepan from heat.  Gradually stir in about half of the hot mixture into the beaten egg yolks.  Return egg mixture to saucepan.  Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, till mixture is slightly thickened and nearly bubbly.  This should take 3-5 minutes.  Remove saucepan from heat.  (Mixture may appear to separate)  Stir in crème de cacao or whipping cream.  Place saucepan in a bowl of ice water, stir occasionally till mixture stiffens and becomes hard to stir (20 minutes).  Transfer Chocolate mixture to a medium mixing bowl.  Beat the cooled chocolate mixture with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 2-3 minutes or till light and fluffy.  Spread filling in a baked pastry shell.  Cover and chill pie about 5 hours or till set, or for up to 24 hours.  At serving time, top each serving with whipped cream and sprinkle with chocolate curls or miniature chocolate pieces, if desired.
