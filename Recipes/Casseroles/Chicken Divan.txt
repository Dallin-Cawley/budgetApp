                           Traditional Chicken Divan
                                  (Serves 4)
Ingredients:
2 bunches broccoli
2 -4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons flour
3⁄4 cup chicken broth
1⁄2 cup milk or 1⁄2 cup half-and-half
1⁄3 cup sherry wine (I used wine vinegar)
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (or more to taste)
salt and pepper
nutmeg

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 325.
Steam broccoli for 5 minutes or until crisp-tender. Alternatively, place broccoli in a shallow bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Microwave for 2-5 minutes (depending on the strength of your microwave) or until crisp-tender. Drain in colander.
In a medium pan, boil seasoned chicken breasts 20-30 minutes until done. Slice when cool.
In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1-2 minutes to eliminate the taste of raw flour. Then gradually whisk in chicken broth, sherry and milk or half and half, until incorporated. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer until the sauce is the consistency you desire. Add just a dash of nutmeg. Add 3/4 of the cheese blend and whisk until combined. Add salt and pepper to taste.
In a 9x13 dish arrange chicken breasts (either whole or sliced) and broccoli. Pour sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Cover with aluminum foil. Make several slits in the aluminum foil to allow the steam to escape.
Note: At this point, the dish can be frozen or refrigerated.
Bake in the oven for 30-45 minutes, taking off the aluminum foil for the last 10.
