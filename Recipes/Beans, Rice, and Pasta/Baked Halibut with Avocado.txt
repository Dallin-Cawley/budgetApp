Ingredients:

Sauce:
2 ripe avocados, halved, pitted, and peeled, divided
1 (1/2) tsp fresh lemon juice
(1/4) tsp onion powder
(1/4) tsp garlic salt
(3/4) cup dairy coffee creamer or half and half, divided

Halibut:
2 eggs
(1/2) cup salsa
(1/2) cup flour
6-6 oz. halibut fillets, skin removed
1 Tbsp olive oil

Instructions: 

Sauce: In a food processor, combine 2 avocados halves, juice, onion power, and garlic salt; process until chopped. With machine running, slowly add (1/4) cup of cream; process until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to serve.  

Halibut: Heat oven to 400Â°. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs. Add remaining cream and the salsa; whisk until blended. Place flour in another bowl. Lightly coat halibut with flour; coat with egg mixture. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet on medium-high heat. Add half the fillets; cook 3 minutes per side or until browned on both sides. Transfer to large baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining fillets, adding more oil if needed. Bake until fillets are just cooked through, 10 minutes. Cut remaining 2 halves of avocado into thin slices. Place halibut on plate and spoon sauce around edge; garnish with avocado slices.
