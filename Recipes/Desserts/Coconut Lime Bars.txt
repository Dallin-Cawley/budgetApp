                               Coconut Lime Bars
                         (Adapted from Our Best Bites)
Ingredients:
   * 2 c. all-purpose flour (lightly spooned into the measuring cup and leveled with a knife)
   * 3/4 cup shredded sweetened coconut, toasted
   * 1/2 c. powdered sugar
   * 1 c. (2 sticks) butter
   * 6 large eggs
   * 6 T freshly-squeezed lime juice
   * 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
   * 6 T all-purpose flour
   * 2 cups white sugar
   * 1 drop green food coloring
   * 1 c. powdered sugar
   * 3 tablespoons strained freshly squeezed lime juice
   * 1/4 cup shredded sweetened coconut, toasted
Instructions:
   1. Preheat oven to 350. Lightly spray a 9x13â€³ pan with non-stick cooking spray and set aside. Whisk together the flour, powdered sugar, and coconut and then cut in the butter with a pastry blender or two knives until the mixture is crumbly. Tip: use a cheese grater to grate cold butter into your flour mixture. Lightly press into the pan and bake for 15-20 minutes or until light golden around the edges. Remove from oven.
   2. During the last few minutes of the shortbread's baking time, mix the eggs, lime juice, flour, sugar, and baking powder in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed for three minutes. The mixture should be frothy and very, very pale yellow. Pour the mixture over the warm crust and then return the pan to the oven for another 20-25 minutes or until lightly golden brown on top. You might want to check the bars at 17-18 minutes to make sure the top isn't getting too dark.
   3. Remove the pan from the oven and allow cooling completely. When the bars are cool, whisk together the glaze ingredients until smooth and then gently spread over the bars. Refrigerate for at least two hours and then cut into squares before serving.
