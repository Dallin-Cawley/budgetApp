This program communicates with a Google Sheet to keep track of expenses. There is also an added functionality of creating a shopping list
based on properlly formatted recipes. If you download the Recipe folder, only use the "Bars and Cookies" recipes because they are the ones
that are formatted correctly.

The Google Sheet functionality has the sheet ID hard codded into it so it will only connect to my Google Sheet. This may or may not work
for you.
