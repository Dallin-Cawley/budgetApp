Ingredients:

1 cup butter, room temperature
4 eggs
5 cups flour
(1/2) tsp baking soda
2 cups sugar
2 tsp vanilla
1 tsp salt
1 tsp lemon zest (optional)

Frosting:
(1/2) cup butter, room temperature
1 tsp vanilla (can use almond extract for half the frosting)
(1/4) tsp salt
5 Tbsp milk
4 oz. cream cheese, softened
4 cups powdered sugar
Food coloring (if desired)

Instructions: 

Cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing after each egg. Add vanilla and mix well. In a separate bowl combine flour, salt, baking soda, and stir with a whisk to combine. Add to wet mixture and mix just until combined. Spread on a greased baking sheet (13x18). Bake at 375Â° for 10-15 minutes, until light golden brown or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. 
Frosting: Combine butter and cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Add vanilla and salt. Add powdered sugar in 1-2 cup increments until combined, then add milk a little at a time and mix until smooth and spreading consistency. You may not need all the milk. Spread over cooled cookie bars.
