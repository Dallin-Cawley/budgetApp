                            Festive Chocolate Bark
Ingredients:
1 c. shelled pistachio nuts (about (1/2) pound in shell)
12 oz. semisweet chocolate, chopped
8 oz. white chocolate, chopped
(3/4) c. dried, sweetened cranberries
Instructions: Heat oven to 350 degrees and lightly toast the pistachio nuts on a baking sheet, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Let the nuts cool.  Melt the semi-sweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler set over simmering water, stirring until smooth.  Or microwave it, in a dry microwave-safe bowl, uncovered, on medium power for 2-3 minutes, stirring once.  Remove the chocolate from the microwave and stir until smooth.  Melt the white chocolate separately, following the same directions.  In a small bowl, combine the nuts and cranberries, then stir half of them into the semisweet chocolate.  Using a spatula, spread the mixture to about a (1/2) inch thickness on a large cookies sheet.  Drop the white chocolate byu tablespoonfuls over the dark.  With the tip of a butter knife, swirl the chocolates together to create a marbled effect.  Sprinkle on the rest of the nuts and berries.  Refrigerate the bark for about 1 hour or until firm, and then break it into pieces.  Makes about 1 (3/4) pounds.
