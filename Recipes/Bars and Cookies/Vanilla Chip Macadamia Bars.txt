Ingredients:

2 (1/2) cups all-purpose flour
1 (1/2) tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1 cup butter, room temperature
1 (1/2) cups brown sugar, packed
2 large eggs
2 tsp vanilla
2 cups vanilla baking chips
1 cup flaked coconut
(1/2)-1 cup macadamia nuts, coarsely chopped

Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350°. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl; set aside. In a medium size bowl, beat butter with brown sugar at medium speed until creamy and lightened in color, about 4 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating at a low speed until combined. Add vanilla extract. Gradually beat in flour mixture. Fold in chips, coconut, and macadamia nuts. Spread batter in a greased 9x13 pan. Bake at 350° for 27-30 minutes. Let cool at least 40 minutes before cutting into squares.
