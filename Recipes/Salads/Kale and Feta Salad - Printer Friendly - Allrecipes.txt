Recipe By: Leslie
"I've been making variations of this salad for years. I recently learned how to massage the kale and it makes a huge
difference. I had a friend ask for my recipe and I realized I don't have one. This is my first attempt at writing a recipe,
so please let me know how it works out! I like to change up the ingredients: sometimes a pear instead of an apple,
cranberries instead of currants, Parmesan instead of feta, etc. Great as a side dish or by itself the next day for lunch!"

Ingredients
1 bunch kale, large stems discarded, leaves finely
chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 apple, diced

1/3 cup feta cheese
1/4 cup currants
1/4 cup toasted pine nuts

Directions
1

Massage kale with salt in a large mixing bowl for 2 minutes. Pour vinegar over the kale and toss to coat. Fold
apple, feta cheese, currants, and pine nuts into the kale.
