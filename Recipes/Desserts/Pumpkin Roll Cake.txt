                                 Pumpkin Roll
Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 c. granulated sugar
1 c. canned pumpkin
1 t. baking powder
1 c. all-purpose flour
(1/2) t. salt
(1/2) t. ground nutmeg
1 t. ground ginger
2 t. ground cinnamon
Filling: 
8 oz. cream cheese, softened
(1/4) c. butter, softened
1 c. powdered sugar
(1/2) t. vanilla
Instructions: Preheat oven to 350.  Grease a jelly roll pan and line bottom with parchment paper, or silicone baking mat.  Beat eggs in medium mixing bowl.  Add sugar; mix well.  Add pumpkin; mix well.  Add remaining ingredients; mix well.  Pour batter into prepared jelly roll pan.  Smooth out as evenly as possible.  Bake 20 minutes.  While cake is baking, spread out large dish towel on counter.  Sprinkle with (1/4) c. powdered sugar.  After removing cake from oven, immediately turn cake out onto the sugar-coated towel.  Remove parchment, wax paper, or silicone mat from bottom of cake.  Roll cake and towel up together the long way.  Put towel rolled cake on cooling rack and let cool at least 30 minutes.  While cake is cooling, make filling by beating cream cheese until smooth.  Add butter and beat until smooth.  Add powdered sugar and vanilla.  Mix well.  When cake has cooled at least 30 minutes, carefully unroll it from the towel (it's okay if it cracks) Spread with room temperature cream cheese filling.  Re-roll cake without the towel.  Put cake on platter and cover.  Refrigerate until serving, at least 1 hour.  (3 hours is best though)
