                           Crockpot Cinnamon Almonds
Ingredients:
1 (1/2) c. sugar
1 (1/2) c. brown sugar
3 T. cinnamon
1/8 t. salt
1 egg white
2 t. vanilla
3 c. almonds
(1/4) c. water
Instructions: In a medium sized bowl, mix together sugars, cinnamon, and salt.  Set aside.  In another medium sized bowl, whisk the egg and vanilla until it's frothy.  Add almonds.  Make sure the almonds are thoroughly coated in the white mixture.  Add cinnamon mixture to the almonds and toss until coated.  Thoroughly spray your crock pot with non-stick cooking spray and add the mixture of almonds and sugars.  Cook on low (with the lids on) 3-4 hours stirring every 20 minutes.  In the second hour, add the (1/4) c. water and stir well.  This ensures a crunchy coating.  Make sure after you've added the water that you continue to cook to the nuts for the remainder of the time.  Line a baking sheet with parchment and spread the almonds flat to cool.
