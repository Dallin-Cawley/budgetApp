                                    Crepes
Ingredients:
2 large eggs
(3/4) c. milk
(1/2) c. water
1 c. flour
3 T. melted butter
Butter, for coating pan
Instructions: In a blender, combine all ingredients and pulse for 10 seconds.  Place the crepe batter in the fridge for 1 hour.  This lets bubbles subside so they are less likely to tear during cooking.  Cook on stove top in a fry pan.  Savory variation: add (1/4) t. salt, (1/4) c. chopped fresh herbs, spinach, or sun dried tomatoes to egg mixture.  Sweet variation: add 2 (1/2) T. sugar, 1 t. vanilla, and 2 T. of your favorite liqueur  to egg mixture.
