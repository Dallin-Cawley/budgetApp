Mexican Haystacks

Ingredients:
Rice:2 cups uncooked brown rice1 bunch fresh cilantroMeat:1 (1/2) lbs ground turkey1 onion, chopped1 Tbsp garlic powdersalt and pepper to taste4 cups salsa (I used Kirkland organic salsa from Costco)Toppings:1-2 avocados, chopped1-2 red peppers, chopped1-2 ripe mangoes, choppedfresh cilantro for garnish

Instructions:Start your brown rice in a pot on the stove, or in a rice maker. Next, add ground turkey and chopped onion to a large saute pan. Add garlic powder and salt and pepper. When the turkey is browned, add 4 cups of salsa. Bring the salsa to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover and simmer for about 20 minutes. In the meantime, chop the cilantro, pepper, avocado, and mango. When the rice is done, simply stir in almost all of the fresh cilantro, leaving just enough to garnish each dish. I served each person with the rice and meat already on the plate, and everybody had fun adding their own toppings. If you are cooking for a smaller family, just chop one avocado, pepper, and mango. You can also make less rice and only 1 lb. of turkey. If you do this, reduce the salsa used to only 2-3 cups.
