(1/2) green bell pepper, diced
(1/2) red bell pepper, diced
14 oz. can crushed tomatoes

Instructions: 

Combine zucchini, squash, carrots, mushrooms, onion, and pepper with water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes or until veggies are tender. Drain well and return to pot. Preheat oven to 350Â°. Combine crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper in medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes. In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, cottage cheese, and eggs. Stir together. Spread (1/3) of sauce evenly over bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Place 4 uncooked lasagna noodles on top of sauce. Do not overlap noodles. Spread (1/2) of cream cheese mixture over the noodles. Cover cheese mixture with (1/2) the vegetable mixture, more sauce, and top evenly with 6 slices of provolone cheese and 1 (1/2) cups mozzarella. Repeat layers with 4 noodles, rest of cream cheese mixture, vegetables, sauce, and remaining cheeses. Place in oven for 35 minutes or until lasagna is hot and bubbling.
