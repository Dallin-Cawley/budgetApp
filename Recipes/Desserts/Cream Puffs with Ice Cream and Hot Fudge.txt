                Cream Puffs with Ice Cream and Hot Fudge Sauce
Ingredients:
(1/2) c. unsalted butter, but into pieces, plus more for baking sheets
(1/4) t. salt
1 c. all-purpose flour
4 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 egg yolk, beaten with 1 t. water, for egg wash
2-3 pints vanilla ice cream, for serving
Hot fudge sauce
Instructions: Make the dough.  Preheat oven to 425.  Butter two large rimmed baking sheets.  Combine butter, 1 c. water, and salt in heavy saucepan.  Bring to boil over high heat, stirring until butter melts.  Reduce heat to medium.  Add flour; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until mixture pulls away from the sides of the pan and forms a ball, 30 seconds to 1 minutes.  Remove from heat; cool one minute.  With an electric handheld mixer, beat in eggs, a little bit at a time, until completely incorporated.  (dough will look shiny and be soft enough to slowly fall off a spoon) Bake the puffs.  Drop heaping tablespoons of batter onto baking sheets about 2 inches apart.  Using pastry brush , lightly brush puffs with egg wash.  (do not let drop on sheets)  Bake rotating sheets between racks halfway through, until puffed and brown, about 25 minutes.  Remove from oven, turn oven off.  With a toothpick, poke of hole in each puff.  Return to oven (still off)  for 10 minutes.  (This helps puffs to dry out)  Fill the puffs: when cool, halve each puff horizontally with a serrated knife.  Working in batches (prevents ice cream from melting) place a small scoop of ice cream (2-3 T) in each bottom half.  Replace tops, press gently.  Arrange on one rimmed baking sheet. Freeze until firm.  Cover with plastic wrap; freeze up to 2 days.  Drizzle puffs with warm fudge sauce when ready to serve.
