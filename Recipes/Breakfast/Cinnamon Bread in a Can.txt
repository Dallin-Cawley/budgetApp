                            Cinnamon Bread in a Can
Ingredients:
6 c. hot tap water
6 T. shortening (I use butter if making rolls)
1 c. sugar
2 T. salt
4 T. yeast
1 (1/2) c. milk powder sifted with 16 c. flour
2 2/3 c. brown sugar
4 T. cinnamon
Instructions: Mix first four ingredients in mixer and let shortening melt.  Add yeast and let dissolve for 5 minutes.  Knead in flour and milk, you may need to add more flour.  Dough should pull away from the bowl but still be a little soft.  Let rise once.  Divide into 8 loaves, should be a little over a pound each.  Roll out and spritz with water; add 1/3 c. brown sugar cinnamon mixture, roll up, double over, and pinch seams together at the bottom.  Drop into large clean soup can and give a little push to fill can.  Let rise with a warm wet towel over the top of cans.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes.  Let brown so they don't end up soggy.
