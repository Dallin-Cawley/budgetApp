YIELD: 2 1/2 cups (40 tablespoons) | SERVES: 20
INGREDIENTS
   * 1 1/4 cups ketchup
   * 1 cup dark brown sugar
   * 1/4 cup molasses
   * 1/4 cup pineapple juice
   * 1/4 cup water
   * 1 tablespoon hickory liquid smoke

   * pinch cayenne pepper
   * 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt

INSTRUCTIONS
   1.    Whisk together all ingredients (except the corn starch in water) in a medium pot over medium heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes, until sugar has dissolved.
   2.    For a thicker sauce, add the corn starch and water mixture. Then simmer for up to 15 minutes, until desired thickness is reached. Keep in mind that it may thicken slightly more while cooling.
   3.    Serve immediately or cover and store in the refrigerator.
NOTES
Once cooled, you may portion and freeze the sauce. Then thaw in the fridge and use as needed.
