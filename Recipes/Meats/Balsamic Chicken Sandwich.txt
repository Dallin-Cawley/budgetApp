                           Balsamic Chicken Sandwich
Ingredients:
2 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed
(1/2) t. salt
(1/2) t. pepper
(1/4) c. whole-wheat flour
3 T. olive oil
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 c. low-fat, reduced sodium chicken broth
(1/2) c. balsamic vinegar
6 T. firmly packed dark-brown sugar
(1/2) c. broccoli puree 
6 ciabatta rolls
6 lg. slices tomato
(1/2) c. grated part-skim mozzarella
Fresh basil (optional)
Instructions: Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.  Spread flour on a sheet of waxed paper.  Toss chicken chunks in flour to coat completely.  Preheat oven to 350.  Warm oil in large skillet over medium high.  Add chicken and garlic.  Lower heat to medium and continue to cook until chicken begins to brown and garlic becomes fragrant, 8-10 minutes.  Add chicken broth, vinegar, and brown sugar.  Bring to a boil.  Cover and simmer 10-15 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the center.  Add puree and cook 2-3 minutes more until flavors are blended.  Place rolls on large baking sheet.  Top each of the 6 bottom halves with a tomato slice and fresh basil.  Divide chicken among them and sprinkle with mozzarella.  Bake until cheese is melted and edges of rolls are crisp, 5-7 minutes.  Serve immediately.
