                               Spanish Delights
                                       
1 lb. grated cheddar cheese (sharp is the best flavor)
1-8 oz. can tomato sauce
1 clove garlic (chopped fine)
3 or 4 green onion (chopped)
1 dozen French rolls
1 can (4 (1/2) oz.) chopped olives
1 can whole California chilies (chopped)
3 hard-boiled eggs, diced

Cut off one end of roll and take out insides leaving shell.  Mix all other ingredients together and fill rolls.  Put end back on roll and individually wrap them in foil.  Bake 30 minutes at 375 degrees.  Let sit for 15 minutes after being taken from oven, allowing the rolls to soften.  Do not unwrap until ready to serve.  Can be frozen and then baked later.
