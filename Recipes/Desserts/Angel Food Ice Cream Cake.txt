                           Angel Food Ice Cream Cake
Ingredients:
1 angel food cake (8 inches)
(1/2) gallon vanilla ice cream, slightly softened
2 quarts fresh strawberries
Sugar or sugar substitute to taste
Instructions: Cut the cake in half; tear one half into small pieces and set aside.  Cut the other half into 12 -14 thin slices; arrange in the bottom of a waxed paper-lined 13X9X2 inch baking pan, overlapping as needed.  Spread softened ice cream over cake, pressing down to smooth.  Gently press the small cake pieces into the ice cream.  Cover and freeze.  Just before serving, slice strawberries and sweeten to taste.  Cut dessert into squares and top with strawberries.  Makes about 15 servings.
