HOMEMADE STABILIZED WHIPPED CREAM
YIELD: ABOUT 8 OZ OF WHIPPED CREAM
INGREDIENTS:
1 1/4 cups heavy whipping cream, cold
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
DIRECTIONS:
1. Add all the ingredients to a large mixer bowl. Whip on high speed. Cream will initially bubble a little bit, then start to thicken.
2. Whip on high speed until stiff peaks form, for a total whipping time of about 5-7 minutes. When you remove the whisk and get little peaks that don't tip over, you are done. Make sure not to over mix! It quickly goes from smooth whipped cream to curdled whipped cream, so watch it closely.
NOTES: You can reduce the amount of powdered sugar if you'd like but then it will not remain stable and will likely "wilt". The amounts above make enough whipped cream to be equal to about 8 oz of Cool Whip.
