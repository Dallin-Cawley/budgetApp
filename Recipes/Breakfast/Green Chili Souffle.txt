                             Green Chili Soufflé
                                       
8 slices white bread, cubed (crust removed)
1 stick margarine
(1/2) lb. cheddar cheese
1 can chopped green chilies
8 eggs
2 c. milk
(1/2) t. salt

Melt margarine in 9X13 pan.  Stir bread cubes into melted margarine, spread evenly in pan.  Grate cheese over the bread in pan.  Spread chopped chilies over cheese.  Separate 8 eggs.  To yolks, add milk and salt, beat well.  Beat egg whites until stiff.  Gently fold beaten egg whites into yolk and milk mixture.  Pour egg mixture over the bread, cheese, and chilies in pan.  You can cover with foil at this point and refrigerate overnight and bake at 325 for 40 minutes.  Or bake immediately at 325 for 30 minutes.  The middle of the soufflé would be set when done (knife inserted in middle should come out clean of eggs, some cheese may stick to knife)  Serve hot.
