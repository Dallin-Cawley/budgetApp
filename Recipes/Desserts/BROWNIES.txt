BROWNIES (Sharen Petersen)

2 cups flour, I was taught to sift it -- now , sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
2 cups sugar
2/3 cup dry cocoa -- this I always sift because I use Hershey's and it clumps.
1 teaspoon baking powder
Then I sprinkle a little salt in it
2 cups milk
(1/2) cup oil, I use pure corn oil
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
Thomas's recipe said to beat it for two minutes.
 
Bake in a 9 x 13 inch pan at 375 for 30 minutes
 
It's a pretty flexible recipe.  Enjoy.
