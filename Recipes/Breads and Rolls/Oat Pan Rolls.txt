Oat Pan Rolls

Ingredients:
2 cup quick-cooking oats
.66 cup packed brown sugar
.25 cup butter, cubed
1 T. salt
2.5 cup boiling water
2 pkg. active dry yeast (1/4 oz. each)
.5 cup warm water
5.5 cup all-purpose flour
Additional butter, melted

Instructions:
Combine the oats, brown sugar, butter, and salt; stir in boiling water.  Cool to 110-115 degrees.  In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water; let stand for 5 minutes.  Add oat mixture and 2 c. flour; beat until smooth.  Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.  Punch dough down.  Turn onto lightly floured surface and divide into 20 pieces.  Place in a grease 9X13 pan.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.  Bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from pan to wire rack.  Brush with melted butter.
